# PROBLEM STATEMENT

The Library Management System is a software solution that automates the processes involved in managing a library. The current manual system used by the library is time-consuming and prone to errors, which affects the efficiency of the library operations. The library staff spends a significant amount of time on tasks such as book issuing, record-keeping, and generating reports. The system also lacks real-time access to information, making it difficult for users to check the availability of books or for staff to keep track of the status of books. 
To address these challenges, a computerized Library Management System is needed that can automate the library processes, reduce errors, and provide real-time access to information. The system should allow users to search for books, place requests, check book availability, and borrow books. It should also provide staff with the ability to manage books, members. Overall, the system should be user-friendly, secure, and scalable to accommodate future growth. 
The Library Management System project aims to develop and implement a comprehensive software solution that will enhance the efficiency of the library operations and improve the user experience for both staff and users.

# MODULE DESCRIPTION

The modules for the Library Management System project could be:
Book class: This module defines the Book class and its properties such as title, author, publisher, year, and stock. It also provides methods to create a Book object and access its properties.
Library class: This module defines the Library class and its properties such as a vector of Book objects. It provides methods to add a book to the library, search for a book by title, borrow a book, and return a book.
User interface: This module provides the user interface for the library management system. It interacts with the user and calls the appropriate methods of the Library class based on the user's input.
Database: This module could be used to store and manage the data of the Library system, such as book information and user information. It could use a database management system or file-based storage to manage the data.
Reporting: This module could generate various reports based on the data stored in the system, such as books borrowed by a user, books available in the library, etc. It could provide these reports in a printable format or export them to a file.
